# pyLoad Desktop Notifications
pyLoad Desktop Notifications (pdn) is a greasemonkey/tampermonkey script which notifies the user when pyLoad has new captchas to solve. 

At the moment, the script does only offer very limited functionality. Over time, the following features are planned to be implemented (in order of importance):
* configuration menu
* improved user interaction
* cross-browser compatibility

## Permissions
* Notifications: To show the captcha notifications
